# Prime-number-checker-and-generator
[prime.rf.gd](http://www.prime.rf.gd) (website is down as of 18/08/2019, sorry)
An website with a prime number checker and generator
### Description
I made the website with basic html and css, and later on added bootstrap, but that doesn't work great yet.
#### -Checker
This is the home page, with some css styling done to it. enter a number to check and it will tell you wether its a prime number or not. In the case of it not beeing a prime number, it will give you the smallest devider. Take a look in the console (f12) and you will see all the deviders off that number.
#### -Generator
When at the generator page you will be prompted with a prompt telling you to enter a number. This is the amount of numbers the programm will check, and when a checked number is prime, it will be displayed.
